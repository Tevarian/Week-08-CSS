      The Museum of Aviation opened to the public on Friday, 9 November 1984
      with 20 aircraft on display in an open field and another 20 were in
      various stages of restoration. The Museum of Aviation has grown to become
      the second largest museum in the United States Air Force and the fourth
      most visited museum in the Department of Defense. The museum is a place
      that honors our veterans and their families and reminds our Airmen of
      their legendary Air Force heritage.
